# ATTX Ontology

The ATTX Workflow ontology has the purpose of describing how and when the data flows within the ATTX platform, types of activities or steps, associated workflows and workflow executions, the provenance information (agent and ETL processes performed) and other metadata.

Its main goal is to abstract the type of data utilised in the workflow and instead focus on the metadata that can be disseminated along with the workflow such as the steps (including the step types and configuration), the input and output datasets along with the activities performed to achieve the end result.

## Repository

This repository contains:
* ATTX Ontology both in RDF/XML v1.1 and v2.0;
* Examples of provenance data annotated with the ontology.
